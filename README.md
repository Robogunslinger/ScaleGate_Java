# ScaleGate_Java
Basic ScaleGate Implementation in Java

This repository provides a basic implementation of the ScaleGate data structure, as presented in the paper "ScaleJoin: a Deterministic, Disjoint-Parallel and Skew-Resilient Stream Join" in the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, by Vincenzo Gulisano, Yiannis Nikolakopoulos, Marina Papatriantafilou, and Philippas Tsigas.

## Package contents
Besides the basic interfaces and the respective implementation, the repository includes also a basic program (or unit test) that uses the ScaleGate to merge and read streams of dummy data (integers), in order to demonstrate the functionality.
